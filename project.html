                                As a master's student studying <B>Applied Data Science</B> at Syracuse University, it was a rewarding experience that challenged my 
                                fundamental understanding of how data is essential in today's data economy.

                                The course focused on the six learning objectives listed below, which were critical in developing the 
                                skillset of a competent data scientist.  
                                <br><br>
                                1. Collect, store, and access data by identifying and leveraging applicable technologies <br>
                                2. Create actionable insight across a range of contexts (e.g. societal, business, political), using data
                                and the full data science life cycle. <br>
                                3. Apply visualization and predictive models to help generate actionable insight. <br>
                                4. Use programming languages such as R and Python to support the generation of actionable insight. <br>
                                5. Communicate insights gained via visualization and analytics to a broad range of audiences
                                (including project sponsors and technical team leads).<br>
                                6. Apply ethics in the development, use and evaluation of data and predictive models (e.g., fairness,
                                bias, transparency, privacy).<br>

                                    I set out to create a futuristic wonderland of IoT devices. I began by crafting a magical local cloud that would unite 
                                    all the gadgets and allow them to converse like old friends. The cloud's primary mission was to control lights and switches 
                                    throughout the kingdom, so I infused it with the power to make bulbs glow and switches click with the flick of a finger. As I completed the project,
                                    I couldn't help but grin with excitement, knowing that we had created a system that would turn the mundane into magic with just a tap on a screen.

                                What I learned:
                                <br><br>
                                Using Azure cloud to log the data from the sensors and switches in the network I learnt to Collect, store, and access data by
                                identifying and leveraging applicable technologies. 
                                <br><br>
                                The IOT data was used to create a forecasting/prediction model that would aid in automation of the device. Through the project 
                                it was outside the scope of the project to create an automation, 
                                but the model helped with pattern recognization which would have translated to a suggestion shortcut for quick actions in the real world
                                <br><br>
                                The end user intended for this project is a normal user with or without technical background. There it was essential to create a visual dashboards 
                                that are easy to understand and clear, which taught me to communicate insights gained via visualization and analytics to a broad range of audiences.

                                Our team of data detectives set out to crack the code of hotel guest booking behavior.

                                every booking detail with a hawk-eyed focus. As we sifted through the data, we uncovered 
                                some juicy insights that would make any hotel owner swoon. We presented the hotel with our findings and suggested clever 
                                strategies to reduce cancellations.

                                    The fashionable data scientists set out to solve the mysteries of clothing retail shopping patterns. With the 
                                    tenacity of a fashionista on a shopping spree, I dug deep into the data, analyzing every stitch and seam of customer behavior. 
                                    With the help of trusted algorithms, I identified key patterns in customer preferences and even predicted their 
                                    next purchases. With this knowledge, I could assist the retailer in developing targeted marketing campaigns that would 
                                    make even the most discriminating fashionista jump for joy.
